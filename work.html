        I've done a lot of different things, some professionally, some not. I
        try to maintain a single identity on GitHub, and publish things there.

      <h2>Selected Work</h2>
      
      <p>
        <b>Wine Classification.</b> I wrote a <a href="downloads/wine.pdf" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a>
        detailing a method to classify wine quality based on chemical properties.
        It was based on prior work, but my method was able to provide good
        classification by reducing the resolution of the "quality" parameter.

        <b>Procecdural Story Generation.</b> An ongoing (ish) project of mine to
        produce believable and interesting stories from a collection of
        vignettes. The motivation is that procedurally generated games lack
        depth, a problem I'm trying to solve by creating narrative. The project
        takes advantage of <a href="https://neo4j.com" target="_blank"><u>neo4j</u></a>
        to organize vignettes by inputs, actions, and outputs in a searchable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spectral Analysis.</b> For my undergraduate capstone, I wrote another
        <a href="downloads/spectral.pdf" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a> with a group of peers,
        exploring signal processing and audio compression. The project expanded
        my understanding of the Fourier transform, in its many forms.

        <b><a href="https://usgs.gov" target="_blank">United States Geological Survey</a>.</b>
        For a year and a half, I worked at the
        <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/geohazards" target="_blank">Geologic Hazards Science Center</a>.
        I contributed to their web architecture, both contributing to existing
        web services and implementing cloud services in 
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS</a>.
