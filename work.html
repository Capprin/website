        I've done a lot of different things, some professionally, some not. I
        try to maintain a single identity on GitHub, and publish things there.

        If you're interested in my work history and experience, download my
        <a href="downloads/resume.pdf" target="_blank"><u>resume</u></a>.
        Otherwise, I've summarized several of my projects below, and have
        included extended descriptions of each project on individual pages.
      </p>

      <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

      <p>
        <b><a href="work/lagrangian.html">Lagrangian Dynamics of a Series Elastic Manipulator</a></b><br>
        This project applies Lagrangian dynamics and some of the structures in 
        <a href="https://www.rosslhatton.com/GeometricMechanicsBook.html">Geometric Mechanics</a> 
        to model and control the dynamics of a manipulator that has series
        elastic actuators. The purpose of this project was to explore the idea
        of traditional manipulators with tunable compliance, which could permit
        working in both industrial applications and alongside people.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="downloads/planning.pdf">Manipulator Path Planning Under Uncertainty</a></b>
        As a class project with two other robotics students (and as a follow-on
        to the above work), I explored kinematic path planning for a manipulator
        with uncertainty in the actuators. This amounted to generating an
        uncertainty metric (the covariance of the actuators) in the joint space,
        which was then projected into the task space to act as a heuristic for
        path planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="work/so3.html">3D Rotational Coordinate Optimization</a></b><br>
        As part of an extended project, we're interested in producing dynamic
        legged locomotion (think running, jumping) on Agility Robotics'
        <a href="https://www.agilityrobotics.com/robots#cassie">Cassie</a>.
        My role in this project built on some previous work by my advisor,
        <a href="http://rosslhatton.com/index.html">Prof. Ross L. Hatton</a>, to
        optimize our choice of rotational coordinates for this robot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="work/drawing.html">Drawn Game Levels using Image Segmentation</a></b><br>
        This project grew out of a sentiment that traditional level design for
        videogames interrupted the creative process. In response, I wrote a tool
        that turns drawings into playable game levels. The application recognizes
        individual items in the drawing, and formats everything into an asset
        format recognizable by the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>
        game engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="work/mckibben.html">Model-Based Control of McKibben Actuators</a></b><br>
        As part of a graduate course in Actuator Dynamics, I modeled the dynamic
        behavior of McKibben actuators, and investigated open- and closed-loop
        control approaches. These "air muscles" have some interesting robot
        applications, but effective control is still a challenge today.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="work/stories.html">Procedural Generation of Stories</a></b><br>
        While procedural generation receives a lot of attention in modern
        videogames, procedurally generated games often feel "empty." I wanted to
        address one potential reason, which is the lack of narrative. This
        project composes a set of related <i>vignettes</i> (story elements) and
        constructs a story <a href="https://neo4j.com">graph</a> to keep track
        of elements (characters, settings, items) in the story.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="downloads/wine.pdf" target="_blank">Wine Classification</a></b><br>
        As a project in one of my undergraduate courses, I designed a
        machine learning approach that classifies wine quality based on chemical
        properties. The dataset derived from prior work, but my method was able
        to provide comparable classification by reducing the resolution of
        measured quality. The full results are detailed in this (unpublished)
        <a href="downloads/wine.pdf" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="downloads/spectral.pdf" target="_blank">Spectral Analysis</a></b><br>
        For my undergraduate capstone, I wrote another unpublished
        <a href="downloads/spectral.pdf" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a> with a
        group of peers, exploring signal processing and audio compression. The
        project expanded my understanding of the Fourier transform, in its many
        forms.
