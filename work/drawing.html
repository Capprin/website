      <h3>Drawn Game Levels using Image Segmentation</h3>
      <b>Background</b>
      <p>
        Most game engines compose levels out of a number of different assets.
        For 2D games, assets are usually images and code, but can also be
        engine-specific constructions like animations or collision boxes.
        Usually, game developers create these assets one at a time, and then
        design complete levels by combining separate assets in the engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt that the existing workflow for creating game levels separated the
        creative process (in content creation) from game design. Instead, I wanted
        to be able to draw complete levels, and load them easily into the engine.
        This way, entire areas could be prototyped quickly, and tested immediately.
        Tweaks can easily be done in-engine, and finished products are built naturally
        from the prototype.
      </p>

      <b>The Project</b>
      <p>
        To acheive drawn game levels, I wrote a set of scripts that segment
        an input drawing into its constituent assets. The major dependency was
        <a href="https://opencv.org/"><u>OpenCV</u></a>, and tasks included:
        <ul>
          <li>Finding contours,</li>
          <li>Computation of minimum bounding boxes,</li>
          <li>Image transformation and saving,</li>
          <li>Construction of engine-compliant level files, and</li>
          <li>Design of complete assets, including colliders.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, below is a test-case image; this version is a flattened
        JPG, but the use of layering allowed artists to specify item types as
        they were creating the level.
        <div class="figure span">
          <img src="../images/drawn_level.jpg" alt="Drawn game level"><br>
          Test environment with multiple asset types
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a single pass, the above image was converted into a game level,
        with constituent assets (images and colliders).
        <div class="figure span">
          <img src="../images/drawn_level.gif" alt="Complete game level"><br>
          In-engine game level (Enable GIF's in your browser)
        </div>
      </p>

      <b>Current Status and Future Work</b>
      <p>
        This project is available on my <a href="https://github.com/Capprin/drawing-games">github</a>.
        Although the underlying process is sound, this method requires that
        asset types are predefined, so the program can adquately translate
        images into complete levels. In addition, much of the code can be
        optimized to take advantage of Godot's <i>scene</i> files, rather than
        constructing assets entirely in-code. I've tabled this project for now,
        but the basic scripts should work in a variety of cases.
