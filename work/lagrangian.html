      <h3>Lagrangian Dynamics of a Series Elastic Manipulator</h3>
      <b>Background</b>
      <p>
        When I started this project, I was interested in the Lagrangian
        dynamics underlying much of my 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10575">own research</a>, as well as
        the idea of manipulators with series elastic actuators. Compliance in
        the system could make people safer around these robots, and stiffness
        could be "brought back" using PD control.
      </p>

      <b>The Project</b>
      <p>
        The bulk of this project involved implementing the dynamics of this
        specific robot arm in MATLAB, using the available integrators to
        simulate the equation(s) of motion over time. The trickiest component
        was modeling the springs in series with the motors; I accomplished this
        by including spring displacement as its own part of the robot state
        space. When all dynamics are accounted for, the arm behaves as one would
        expect with no control strategy.

      <p>
        In this instance, control is as simple as using a PD controller to track
        the position setpoint over time. This controller is intimately related
        to the series elastic actuators powering the manipulator; the
        proportional gain adjusts the spring constant, and the derivative gain
        adds damping to the system. With a little bit of damping added, the
        system behaves much less erratically.

      <b>Current Status and Future Work</b>
      <p>
        The source for this project is available on my 
        <a href="https://github.com/Capprin/soft-arm-sim">github</a>. This was
        effectively an exercise in implementation of Lagrangian dynamics for a
        real system; the approach ought to scale well for any sort of
        manipulator, due to its group-aware construction. However, this sort of
        code <i>ought</i> to be available in any good dynamics library, or
        provided when a manipulator is purchased.
