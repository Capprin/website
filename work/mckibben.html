      <h3>Dynamic Modeling and Control of McKibben Actuators</h3>
      <b>Background</b>
      <p>
        McKibben actuators are pneumatic actuators that contract when
        pressurized. They were originally designed to be used as "air muscles,"
        and indeed have some similarities with muscular tissue. Their
        contraction is highly nonlinear, as contraction rate decreases with
        absolute pressure and muscles exhibits elastic properties.
      </p>

      <b>The Project</b>
      <p>
        This project involved the modeling of McKibben actuators, with the
        purpose of attempting and evaluating control methods. Based on prior
        work and data, I modeled the behavior of McKibben actuators; here, we
        can see the effect of pressurization and depressurization.

          nonlinearities in contraction, and depressurization demonstrates
          anisotropy.

        In addition, I worked with other students to implement and evaluate
        control methods. For example, here we attempt position control on a
        periodic (sinusoid) target:

          PD controller both leads and lags the target (depending on phase),
          and actuator limits prevent perfect results.

      <b>Current Status and Future Work</b>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to demonstrate the limits of McKibben
        actuators. In general, other actuators (motors, in particular) perform
        better in robotics tasks, with fewer control challenges. For specific
        applications, McKibbens can still be the correct choice, as done in
        certain manipulation domains, or for robots designed for deployment in
        radioactive environments.
