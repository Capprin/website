      <h3>Procedural Generation of Stories</h3>
      <b>Background</b>
      <p>
        Procedural generation is both a buzzword and a sin in videogames.
        Small studios can leverage procedural content to create massive worlds;
        however, these environments often feel empty compared to human-generated
        levels. The narrative (or lack thereof) is partly to blame. A human-made
        game like Skyrim has much more engaging questlines than a game like No
        Man's Sky, with procedural objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with this project was to programmatically generate engaging
        storylines. While the intended purpose was for videogames, the stories
        had to reasonably stand on their own. As such, this project was
        motivated by the creation of believable stories, while allowing
        integration into a game engine.
      </p>

      <b>The Project</b>
      <p>
        In this project, stories are defined as a collection of vignettes. A
        single vignette describes an event or progression of the story. This can
        be as simple as a character obtaining a key item, or more sentimental, like
        the betrayal of a close friend. The task is to organize a set of
        vignettes into a reasonable story.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key innovation of this project is in representing the story as a
        graph. This lets the program (in particular, the <i>author</i>) query
        whether a particular vignette "fits" in the story. For example, the
        following (program-generated) graph contains the Protagonist's
        relationships at some point in the story.
        <div class = "figure">
          <img src = "../images/graph_example.JPG" alt="Graph Example"><br>
          Story association graph.
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because vignettes are effectively queries or insertions on the graph,
        we can design arbitrarily intricate vignettes, or completely distinct
        kinds of stories without changing code. The choice of vignette/story
        architecture is decoupled from the program, which is essential if others
        are to use this approach.
      </p>

      <b>Current Status and Future Work</b>
      <p>
        This project successfully generates stories from the supplied vignettes;
        however, random selection of "fitting" vignettes is insufficient to
        create a sensible story. The stories (as they currently stand) fail to
        capture a reasonable story arc; to do so, more imposing constraints on
        the number and type of vignettes must be implemented. These would likely
        follow established literary standards for narrative.
