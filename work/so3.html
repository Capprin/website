      <h3>3D Rotational Coordinate Optimization on SO(3)</h3>
      <b>Background</b>
      <p>
        My Masters advisor, <a href="http://rosslhatton.com/index.html">Prof. Ross L. Hatton</a>,
        found that choice of body coordinates impacts system stability, from a
        mathematical point of view. The optimal choice of coordinates, termed
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509876"><u>Minimum Perturbation Coordinates</u></a>,
        is a particularly stable coordinate choice for robot systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In collaboration with several other OSU robotics students, I'm working
        on a project to execute dynamic gaits (running, jumping) on Agility
        Robotics' <a href="https://www.agilityrobotics.com/robots#cassie">Cassie</a>.
        Optimization of the robot's rotational coordinates is necessary to
        effectively reconcile differences in the optimal robot trajectory and
        the learned motor commands.
      </p>

      <b>The Project</b>
      <p>
        Based on methods (and verified against) a
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6580130">previous conference paper</a>,
        I implemented a coordinate optimizer for the 3D rotation group, SO(3).
        In essence, it chooses body coordinates (with respect to configuration)
        such that moving the robot's actuators minimally rotates the body of the
        robot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SO(3) coordinate optimizer is highly general-purpose; it can support
        (in theory) robot systems with an arbitrary number of actuators, in any
        configuration. The objective function is defined over an N-dimensional
        hypercube mesh, and integrated with quadrature integration. The optimal
        transform is found as a set of weights on piecewise-linear basis
        functions, defined over the mesh.
      </p>

      <b>Current Status and Future Work</b>
      <p>
        The optimizer is complete, and produces minimum-perturbation coordinates
        for supplied systems. As an example, note the change in displacement for
        a test gait on a reaction-wheel satellite, in minimum perturbation
        coordinates:

          Resultant displacement, in original and optimal coordinates.
        </div>
      </p>

      <p>
        At time of writing, I'm integrating the SO(3) coordinate optimizer into
        <a href="https://github.com/OSU-LRAM/GeometricSystemPlotter"><u>sysplotter</u></a>,
        the lab application for geometric-mechanical tools. This will allow for
        the study of complex systems on SO(3), with the addition of preexisting
        computation and visualization tools. In the upcoming months, results
        ought to be published in an journal article, extending the conference
        paper.
